        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in New York City but spent most of my life growing up in Shanghai, which gave me a unique blend of Eastern and Western perspectives. Living between two cultures has shaped how I think, connect with people, and approach challenges. I’m currently studying Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon, where I’m exploring the intersection of technology, design, and human behavior. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball, going to the gym, and diving into whatever sparks my curiosity.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>Front-End Software Engineer Intern @ Datu Medical</h3>
        <p class="dates"><em>May 2025 – June 2025 · Internship</em></p>
        <p>
          Developed and enhanced features for RTCenter, a radiotherapy task
          management system used by clinicians at local hospitals to coordinate
          treatment workflows. Contributed production-level code in Angular and
          TypeScript, resolving UI/UX bugs and developing integrated features
          such as configurable forms, dynamic modals, role-based access
          controls, and context-aware validation logic. Communicated with
          clients (public hospitals across the nation) to align feature designs
          with real-world needs, translating feedback into interface
          improvements that streamlined patient data entry and task
          configuration. Worked closely with the engineering team through
          Git-based workflows to ensure code consistency, reusability, and
          smooth integration into the main product.
